I deal with about a dozen engineering consulting companies on a regular basis.

They are going to hold us to the letter on the specs, better make sure we don't miss anything in the tender!\" \n\nThis year? It's has been the exact opposite. I have -never- found more design flaws or major missed items on projects as I have this year. But it's not just limited to the big projects. I have had quantities missed by orders of magnitudes. On one project alone, we bid $3M. I have found at least $1M in additional quantities. \n\nAnd these are -BASIC- quantity mistakes. Things like stripping a ditch that is 650m long. And 1m ditch bottom, 1m deep on average, with 3:1 side slopes. They put 850m2 in for stripping of topsoil.\n\nI have spent weeks of my time reviewing design files in Autocad to find out issues with designs. All stamped and supposedly reviewed.

      "selftext": "The following is a true story. Such bravery, heroism, and triumph against the most insurmountable odds have rarely been encountered in the vast realm of engineering and were brought about by my hand. I will relate to you my tale, though it unnerves me to the deepest caverns of my soul to have to relive such a harrowing ordeal as this.\n\nFor fourteen years I have fulfilled my duty as Manufacturing Engineer, acting as the stalwart defender of my CEO's stock portfolio and pursuing the magnificent promise of a 1% chance of a pat on my back from my boss in exchange for the soul that my employer demands of me. And I have seen much in my travels, but none were as dark and as dire as what befell me this morning.\n\nI was in the midst of performing my duties, transporting a 1-ton machine for repairs and actively conversing with my coworker when I was accosted by one of our manufacturing personnel, placing herself immediately between me and my coworker, severing any possibility of continued conversation, a conversation that surely paled in comparison to the crisis that demanded my attention. With terror in her eyes, a look of dread smeared across her face, and unwavering urgency in her motivations, she spared no efforts utilizing tact or allowing my conversation to continue for so much as a further picosecond. Having so forcefully gained my attention, she then delivered to me the grave news which was sure to portend the coming apocalypse and envelop all of humanity in the deepest, darkest bowels of hell for all of eternity: *her machine would not power up.*\n\nYes, dear reader, take a moment to realize how close you came to utter calamity and despair, though thankfully you were kept unaware of the crisis thanks to the swift vanquish of a mighty foe. But it is true. A machine was not powering up. It shall render me helpless and terror-stricken in bed this night with renewed nightmares just to speak of it, but in putting this harrowing ordeal to the pen, I pray I may never again relive such horror.\n\nRegardless, in light of the ominous situation I now found myself in, I mustered up all of my courage and made the tortuous journey to the machine, all the while fighting my inner demons screaming at me the horrors that would surely befall all of humanity were I to fail in my quest to turn the machine on. And using every bit of courage and confidence I could muster, I steeled myself against my doubts and pressed on to my objective.\n\nAt long last, I arrived at the machine. And the situation was indeed as grim as this manufacturing personnel had described: the machine was off.\n\nI then began what I will always remember as the most magnificent and impressive utilization of my mind that seemingly shattered any limits I previously had mistakenly assumed were the extent of my abilities. No, dear reader, I found myself suddenly recounting all I had learned in my vast engineering career and parsing through the vast depths of my knowledge and experiences in just a brief number of heartbeats, recalling my learnings of quantitative element analysis, of multivariate engineering equations, of the most confounding and complex equipment failures I have ever courageously fought against, and through the permutations and amalgamations and pure-genius-ations that somehow worked their way through my consciousness in that brief moment, I arrived at an action plan to vanquish the mighty foe that stood before me now: *I would flip the power switch to ON.*\n\n\"Stand back, citizens! Lest the task I am about to undertake is successful, it may claim my life and devour my soul for all eternity, but such is my sense of duty to humanity that I now lay down my life in protection of my people!\"* Mustering all the courage and resolve that I could, I placed my fingertips on the red knob sitting on the front of the electrical panel, the word \"OFF\" staring back at me with the seething hatred of a being of pure evil that knows its demise is about to be wrought by the righteous, and with the heroes of old encouraging me from their distant but ever-present realities, I did flip that switch to ON, vanquishing the mighty foe of OFF and restoring power to my machine. Nay, that was not all that was restored... Surely it also restored our future, our hope as a people, our CEO's capital gains. All was right in the world once more.\n\nAnd though it was an arduous task for me to relive what was surely the blackest moment of my life, it gives me pleasure to know that my act of heroism averted a terrifying fate for my people. May we all find such similar heroism in the darkest of times.\n\n*this part of the story may be embellished slightly.",

And I have seen much in my travels, but none were as dark and as dire as what befell me this morning.</p>\n\n<p>I was in the midst of performing my duties, transporting a 1-ton machine for repairs and actively conversing with my coworker when I was accosted by one of our manufacturing personnel, placing herself immediately between me and my coworker, severing any possibility of continued conversation, a conversation that surely paled in comparison to the crisis that demanded my attention. With terror in her eyes, a look of dread smeared across her face, and unwavering urgency in her motivations, she spared no efforts utilizing tact or allowing my conversation to continue for so much as a further picosecond. Having so forcefully gained my attention, she then delivered to me the grave news which was sure to portend the coming apocalypse and envelop all of humanity in the deepest, darkest bowels of hell for all of eternity: <em>her machine would not power up.</em></p>\n\n<p>Yes, dear reader, take a moment to realize how close you came to utter calamity and despair, though thankfully you were kept unaware of the crisis thanks to the swift vanquish of a mighty foe. But it is true. A machine was not powering up. It shall render me helpless and terror-stricken in bed this night with renewed nightmares just to speak of it, but in putting this harrowing ordeal to the pen, I pray I may never again relive such horror.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, in light of the ominous situation I now found myself in, I mustered up all of my courage and made the tortuous journey to the machine, all the while fighting my inner demons screaming at me the horrors that would surely befall all of humanity were I to fail in my quest to turn the machine on. And using every bit of courage and confidence I could muster, I steeled myself against my doubts and pressed on to my objective.</p>\n\n<p>At long last, I arrived at the machine. And the situation was indeed as grim as this manufacturing personnel had described: the machine was off.</p>\n\n<p>I then began what I will always remember as the most magnificent and impressive utilization of my mind that seemingly shattered any limits I previously had mistakenly assumed were the extent of my abilities. No, dear reader, I found myself suddenly recounting all I had learned in my vast engineering career and parsing through the vast depths of my knowledge and experiences in just a brief number of heartbeats, recalling my learnings of quantitative element analysis, of multivariate engineering equations, of the most confounding and complex equipment failures I have ever courageously fought against, and through the permutations and amalgamations and pure-genius-ations that somehow worked their way through my consciousness in that brief moment, I arrived at an action plan to vanquish the mighty foe that stood before me now: <em>I would flip the power switch to ON.</em></p>\n\n<p>&quot;Stand back, citizens! Lest the task I am about to undertake is successful, it may claim my life and devour my soul for all eternity, but such is my sense of duty to humanity that I now lay down my life in protection of my people!&quot;* Mustering all the courage and resolve that I could, I placed my fingertips on the red knob sitting on the front of the electrical panel, the word &quot;OFF&quot; staring back at me with the seething hatred of a being of pure evil that knows its demise is about to be wrought by the righteous, and with the heroes of old encouraging me from their distant but ever-present realities, I did flip that switch to ON, vanquishing the mighty foe of OFF and restoring power to my machine. Nay, that was not all that was restored... Surely it also restored our future, our hope as a people, our CEO&#39;s capital gains. All was right in the world once more.</p>\n\n<p>And though it was an arduous task for me to relive what was surely the blackest moment of my life, it gives me pleasure to know that my act of heroism averted a terrifying fate for my people. May we all find such similar heroism in the darkest of times.</p>\n\n<p>*this part of the story may be embellished slightly.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I’m in my 20s, I’ve got a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in engineering from a prestigious school. I was drawn to this stuff when I was younger because I loved science and wanted to work for the space program. My interests changed as I got older but I still enjoyed what I was studying and got very good grades in college. Since graduating I’ve worked for two companies, both completely different. One was a gigantic Fortune 500 company, straight out of Dilbert, complete with endless rows of cubicles. I thought the company and corporate environment was the source of my discontent, so I quit that and found a new job. Where I work now is a very small high-tech startup. I also interned at a mid-sized firm, and each of these three companies were in completely different industries, so I feel like I’ve seen a representative cross-section of the engineering world. \n\nI’ve fallen completely out of love with engineering. Nothing about it excites me anymore, and it’s far from being my “passion”, in the college-admissions-essay sense of the word. I look at older engineers and ask myself if I want to be like them in 10 or 15 years, and the answer is always, “hell no!” I don’t find the work interesting and don’t see any options or career moves within engineering that would excite me. Many of the subjects I studied in school were fascinating, but the actual day-to-day work of engineering is very dull to me. I don’t believe it’s just because I’m a younger engineer and thus lower on the totem pole; I’ve worked with many middle-aged engineers who basically did the same work as me despite their seniority. It’s not as if I was given the boring work no one else wanted, in my current job and last job I’ve been leading teams and I’ve been in positions of significant responsibility.\n\nMy problem is that I have no idea how I can make a major career change after I’ve invested so much blood, sweat, and tears in engineering. I feel like it would be very difficult to switch to something else with my educational and work background. I’d really like to avoid going back to college, to pursue an MBA for example, because I’m not sure what that would accomplish and it would be a major financial cost. I really feel like I have to get out of this and try something else, because I can’t see myself doing this for the rest of my life. I just have no idea how to go about this.\n\nThe only thing I feel really passionate about is writing. I’ve been writing fiction (like, actual original stories, not anime fan-fiction) for about a year, I set aside time to write every single day. I haven’t submitted anything to be published yet, but I really enjoy it and dream about becoming a published author. I’d love to pursue this full time, but I feel like it will take a few years to polish my skills to the point I can be published, and even then, it may not be a viable source of income for a long time, assuming I’m even successful. \n\nI realize that this is really #firstworldproblems. I’m employed in a well-paying job with healthcare, just based on that I’m better off than a lot of people out there. I’m not asking for pity or claiming to be worse off than anyone else, I just feel a lot of discontent and uncertainty about my future and I’m wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar. What have you done to change your career and take a radically different path? Has anyone else ever decided in their early twenties that what they went to school for wasn’t what they wanted to do with their life? What other career options do I have with an engineering degree? Any advice is greatly appreciated. \n",

My interests changed as I got older but I still enjoyed what I was studying and got very good grades in college. Since graduating I’ve worked for two companies, both completely different. One was a gigantic Fortune 500 company, straight out of Dilbert, complete with endless rows of cubicles. I thought the company and corporate environment was the source of my discontent, so I quit that and found a new job. Where I work now is a very small high-tech startup. I also interned at a mid-sized firm, and each of these three companies were in completely different industries, so I feel like I’ve seen a representative cross-section of the engineering world. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve fallen completely out of love with engineering. Nothing about it excites me anymore, and it’s far from being my “passion”, in the college-admissions-essay sense of the word. I look at older engineers and ask myself if I want to be like them in 10 or 15 years, and the answer is always, “hell no!” I don’t find the work interesting and don’t see any options or career moves within engineering that would excite me. Many of the subjects I studied in school were fascinating, but the actual day-to-day work of engineering is very dull to me. I don’t believe it’s just because I’m a younger engineer and thus lower on the totem pole; I’ve worked with many middle-aged engineers who basically did the same work as me despite their seniority. It’s not as if I was given the boring work no one else wanted, in my current job and last job I’ve been leading teams and I’ve been in positions of significant responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>My problem is that I have no idea how I can make a major career change after I’ve invested so much blood, sweat, and tears in engineering. I feel like it would be very difficult to switch to something else with my educational and work background. I’d really like to avoid going back to college, to pursue an MBA for example, because I’m not sure what that would accomplish and it would be a major financial cost. I really feel like I have to get out of this and try something else, because I can’t see myself doing this for the rest of my life. I just have no idea how to go about this.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing I feel really passionate about is writing. I’ve been writing fiction (like, actual original stories, not anime fan-fiction) for about a year, I set aside time to write every single day. I haven’t submitted anything to be published yet, but I really enjoy it and dream about becoming a published author. I’d love to pursue this full time, but I feel like it will take a few years to polish my skills to the point I can be published, and even then, it may not be a viable source of income for a long time, assuming I’m even successful. </p>\n\n<p>I realize that this is really #firstworldproblems. I’m employed in a well-paying job with healthcare, just based on that I’m better off than a lot of people out there. I’m not asking for pity or claiming to be worse off than anyone else, I just feel a lot of discontent and uncertainty about my future and I’m wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar. What have you done to change your career and take a radically different path? Has anyone else ever decided in their early twenties that what they went to school for wasn’t what they wanted to do with their life? What other career options do I have with an engineering degree? Any advice is greatly appreciated. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
