📝 DISCUSSION:
I went to my universitiy's engineering career fair today. I was talking to someone at one of the company booths. I informed him that I am looking for my first internship. He then proceeds to grill me and interrogate me on why I don't have any internship experience yet. I thought the whole point of internships was to get your first hands-on experience. Requiring previous experience seems like it defeats the whole purpose of an internship. These companies only want to hire interns to do their grunt work because they are too cheap to hire an actual engineer for it.



At another booth, the guy I spoke to seemed hungover and totally disinterested.

I hate recruiters, I hate their stupid polo shirts, I hate their spam messages on linkedin and handshake. I hate that they always schedule these things in the middle of the week when we're are all busy with classes. I hate having to wear a suit and tie while the recruiters look like slobs. Thats all.

My highschool didn’t have any AP tests or even calculus classes (the highest level math was pre-calculus) so I started my math at Uni in “College Algebra”.

Now I’m in my early 20s doing Calc 3 with a bunch of 18-19 year olds that “just took calculus ab and bc in highschool”. (I didn’t even know what that meant until last year)

A little demoralizing. Like I’d kill to have a 2 year head start in math or physics :/

📝 DISCUSSION:
Title basically.

I graduated from an engineering school in Texas at the end of 2023 with a job right out of college in the energy industry. After working for a little over a year I asked my company if I could go to my schools career fair with the recruiters and they let me.

I see a lot of things get bandied about by people, both doomer mentalities and overly optimistic that I'd give my perspective on if it comes up. The main one being: GPA absolutely (at my company) matters. It isn't the end all, but it is heavy consideration.

I feel that at 90% of universities, 90% of the time, there isn't a benefit to going to a career fair.

Your personality might make an impression on the recruiter, but they're just a recruiter and they seem so many students a day. They won't remember you. 

Maybe it could be beneficial to bypass the AI filter slop most companies use, but any good resume in 2024 can easily do that.

I have had my internship since freshman year and it is with a pretty big company. I have made connections with every person in there besides the corporate HQ folk. I cannot count on two hands how many individual times I have been invited to play golf with the higher ups. Shit I wish I had learned how to play because that alone appears to be a great opportunity. Should have been an undergraduate class for sure. Lean golf, you never know when you’re going to use it as an icebreaker with the CEO.

📝 DISCUSSION:
Tomorrow my university is hosting a STEM career fair for engineering students. When I went last spring, I ended up spending a lot of time waiting in line to speak with big players in the engineering space such as Lockheed, L3, Honeywell, etc. Consequently, by the time I finished waiting in line and speaking with these employers, there was hardly any time for me to speak with the many other smaller employers at the fair. I mentioned this to some of my buddies with careers in engineering, and they advised me to not even waste my time speaking with these employers, that I'm much better off just applying online and attempting to make a connection with the smaller employers. When I spoke to the Lockheed recruiters last spring, they actually seemed to want to engage in conversation and hear what I had to say. When I spoke to L3, I gave them my pitch and it was kind of just like "uh huh, uh huh, next applicant" and felt like a major waste of time after waiting in line for 30 minutes. I'm interested in hearing what others think about this, is it really even worth it to speak with these major companies, or should I just apply online and spend my time elsewhere?

📝 DISCUSSION:
How many of you actively WANT to work as an engineer versus hoping to enter another career path, or just being stuck with whatever job prospects engineering lands you? I’m not particularly passionate about engineering, but nothing else really excites me either and I believe it’s a steady, somewhat interesting career path that will provide me with decent income and work life balance. I just can’t imagine myself as an engineer 40 years down the road. 

Edit: Thank you for all the responses! I know it’s not realistic to plan my whole career out haha, I guess I still just struggle to even know what a career in engineering *could* look like since I haven’t had an internship yet. I’m going to try and connect with some people with industry experience next semester to see if that will help me decide what I want to do after college.

Hello, fellow engineering students!

I’m a young Gen Z man halfway through my electrical engineering degree. Lately, I’ve been feeling uneasy after seeing so many headlines and hearing stories about how engineering roles are supposedly in decline. I keep coming across posts from recent grads struggling to find jobs, even after years of hard work.

Meanwhile, skilled trades seem to be booming. I constantly hear tradespeople discussing their job security, excellent pay and benefits, and how quickly they entered the workforce. The contrast is striking—engineering grads often sound burned out or discouraged, while tradespeople seem satisfied and stable.

So I graduated this past May. The only thing I didn't like about school was the fact that, since I was also working, it was like working two jobs and only getting paid for one of them. I was busy all the time but only making a part-time salary. I like my new job, but I miss the challenge and learning that I had in school. I finally got a project recently that involves learning some complex mathematical concepts and using all that calculus I learned, but I can tell that projects like this are going to be rare. It makes me miss studying sorta. I wish I could do this full time but still get paid well and have my nights and weekends free.

📝 DISCUSSION:
So here’s my concern. Career services makes career fairs sound like the holy grail for internships. But the more I look at it, the more it seems like companies just direct you back to their online application portal anyway.

I get that career fairs might be good for practice and seeing who’s hiring, but if the end result is still “go apply online,” then is there really a point beyond grabbing the list of attending companies and checking them out later?

For context, I already feel good about my interview skills and resume (mock interview went well, GPA is strong). What I care about is ROI. Am I missing some hidden advantage to fairs (like referrals, actually standing out), or are they basically just billboards for the company pipeline?

📝 DISCUSSION:
It has destroyed my future in ways I can't even fathom. I have already been told I can't get into grad school. Academic advisor said it would take 2 years to raise my GPA. I don't have 2 years to put my career and dreams of a family on hold. I have already seen SOOOOOOOO many internships that I WOULD be able to qualify for if they didn't have that horrible 3.0 GPA requirement. Even small, local companies have a 3.0 GPA requirement. No internship. No hope of decent paying job. 

I try my absolute DAMNDEST to network and make connections and do extracurriculars but it's all meaningless because I don't have an internship under my belt. All because I don't have a "good" GPA. Companies stupidly assume I'm too dumb to tie my own shoes just because of a NUMBER. 

And I get it!!! Engineering is super competitive because so many people want to be one and it requires a lot of knowledge. I get it. But the RIDICULOUS difficulty of being bad grades expunged makes an unfair challenge for students trying to turn their lives around.

📝 DISCUSSION:
I’m not taking a minor but my friend is. 

We are both in mechanical engineering but he’s taking a minor in history. He only has to take a few classes for that so it’s not like a really hard thing for him to get. 

I was wondering if it will impact anything? Like maybe better chance to get internship idk.
