📌 INSIGHT #1: Young Engineers: do not trust AI at its word.

📝 DISCUSSION:
This week, I was designing a safety gate for a piece of equipment which can surely kill someone. I’m not well educated on guarding standards and we currently don’t have a person internal to the company who is an expert. 

I plugged the information into ChatGPT and asked it to provide the standards for height, clearances, etc. It did a deep dive, provided tables and citations, etc. It was extremely convincing.

The problem? The numbers didn’t pass the gut check. I did a deeper dive, which took a few hours identifying ANSI standards and finding the correct information. Turns out, what ChatGPT recommended would have been against ANSI standards and extremely dangerous.

📌 INSIGHT #2: I believe work from home has done immeasurable harm for young engineers careers

📝 DISCUSSION:
I will preface this by saying that I am a Civil Engineering Technologist. I'm a project manager for a road building/ underground utility construction company. I deal with about a dozen engineering consulting companies on a regular basis. Normally a select few, however this year we have been lucky enough to get on some fairly major provincial government highway projects. 

These government projects "Alberta Transportation", used to be what we would look at as a project we would need to dot our i's and cross our t's.  "Oh it's an AT project? They are going to hold us to the letter on the specs, better make sure we don't miss anything in the tender!" 

This year? It's has been the exact opposite. I have -never- found more design flaws or major missed items on projects as I have this year. But it's not just limited to the big projects. I have had quantities missed by orders of magnitudes. On one project alone, we bid $3M. I have found at least $1M in additional quantities.

📌 INSIGHT #3: One of my finest moments in my 14 year engineering career.

📝 DISCUSSION:
The following is a true story. Such bravery, heroism, and triumph against the most insurmountable odds have rarely been encountered in the vast realm of engineering and were brought about by my hand. I will relate to you my tale, though it unnerves me to the deepest caverns of my soul to have to relive such a harrowing ordeal as this.

For fourteen years I have fulfilled my duty as Manufacturing Engineer, acting as the stalwart defender of my CEO's stock portfolio and pursuing the magnificent promise of a 1% chance of a pat on my back from my boss in exchange for the soul that my employer demands of me. And I have seen much in my travels, but none were as dark and as dire as what befell me this morning.

I was in the midst of performing my duties, transporting a 1-ton machine for repairs and actively conversing with my coworker when I was accosted by one of our manufacturing personnel, placing herself immediately between me and my coworker, severing any possibility of continued conversation, a conversation that surely paled in comparison to the crisis that demanded my attention. With terror in her eyes, a look of dread smeared across her face, and unwavering urgency in her motivations, she spared no efforts utilizing tact or allowing my conversation to continue for so much as a further picosecond. Having so forcefully gained my attention, she then delivered to me the grave news which was sure to portend the coming apocalypse and envelop all of humanity in the deepest, darkest bowels of hell for all of eternity: *her machine would not power up.*

📅 Date: Aug 13, 2025
🔗 Link: https://reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1mpcml4/why_do_people_in_the_uk_not_know_what_engineering/

📝 DISCUSSION:
After accepting that software development jobs are impossible to get now, I have recently been looking into engineering jobs and qualifications to see whether it's actually possible to get into the field (I am not asking for career advice), and my first observation is that nobody seems to know what engineering is.

People think engineering means things like operating machines in a factory, installing equipment on a building, performing maintenance and repairs, assembling things, etc. Any time I have tried to look for engineering jobs, these are the only things that come up. Well, these, and even less engineering-related things like "sales engineer", "tech support engineer", etc.

A while ago I had an appointment with the national careers service, who are supposed to provide career advice, guidance, etc. and they didn't know what engineering was either. I asked about engineering, and just got information about welding, forklift driving, and machine operating.

📝 DISCUSSION:
Got fired back in June and have applied for 100 jobs since, 2 of which I landed interviews. I only have 4 months of experience. 

I'm about to turn 27 in a couple months and don't really want to get a Master's as it took me almost 7 years to graduate (Civil Engineering major). Plus I'd be almost 30 by the time I finish my Master's.

Is my career salvageable?

📝 DISCUSSION:
Like everybody who Is are being fed this narrative that majoring in engineering is some kind of ticket to financial freedom. Like when you graduate, you're guaranteed to be starting at 60k-85k etc.  

How true is this? Because I knew old cats who are engineers who hated the job market and struggled to even find work. And not only that, they hated the work. Like they hated the cube life. What is it really like out there?
